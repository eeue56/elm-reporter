# elm-reporter

This reporter module is designed to be used in production for exporting user sessions to be used in the [elm-reactor](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor)

Almost all the work is based off of [vilterp](https://github.com/vilterp)'s great work, just extracted and applied in a different context.
